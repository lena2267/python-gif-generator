# 🎞️ Python GIF Generator

A fun little 6-line Python project that creates a GIF from multiple images using the **Pillow** library 🐍  
Built just for practice and to explore simple automation with Python.

---

## 🧩 What it does
- Takes a few `.png` or `.jpg` images  
- Combines them into a looping `.gif`  
- Uses just a few lines of code (simple but satisfying 😌)

---

## ⚙️ How to Run
```bash
pip install pillow
python create_gif.py
